# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.9] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Added a footer to assistant messages in chat: response duration and output token count (with icons) on the left, message time on the right. Duration and token count are also shown for messages restored from session history.

### Fixed

- Fixed live assistant response durations using the response start timestamp for both endpoints, and preserved duration metadata when the chat state is refreshed.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Fixed the agent system prompt reporting `mermaid@unknown` in packaged builds: the VSIX staging script stripped `dependencies` from `package.json`, which is where the extension reads the bundled mermaid version at runtime; the staged manifest now keeps the `mermaid` entry.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Added an environment note to the agent system prompt: it now includes the extension version (with a `-dev` suffix for development builds) and the bundled mermaid version, so the agent writes mermaid diagrams compatible with the chat renderer.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Added pan and zoom for mermaid diagrams in chat: drag to pan, mouse wheel or trackpad pinch to zoom around the cursor, and zoom in/out/reset buttons overlaid on the diagram.
- Added provider login and logout from the chat view: new `Pi: Login` / `Pi: Logout` commands, a login button in the chat view title, and a "Login..." retry action when selecting a model that is not authenticated.
- Added an assistant message header with avatar and author name in the chat webview.
- Added `@` file mention and `/` slash command autocomplete in the chat input, with keyboard navigation and IME-aware triggering.
- Added a drag handle above the chat input to resize it between the default height and twice that height.
- Added folder candidates to `@` file completion: matching folders appear with a trailing `/` and can be completed into without closing the menu.
- Added bold (`**text**`) and italic (`*text*`) rendering in chat messages.

### Changed

- Chat prompts expand `@file` mentions into file contents before sending; only real workspace files are expanded, `@@path` handles paths starting with `@`.
- Split chat view state management out of `PiChatViewProvider`.
- Split Pi agent session history and event mapping out of `PiAgentService`.
- Smoothed streaming responses with a typewriter reveal and animation-frame-coalesced renders; messages now fade in when appended and fade out when removed.
- Error messages in chat now render like regular assistant messages, including the avatar header.
- User messages now render as right-aligned bubbles that shrink to fit their content, without a border and with a square bottom-right corner.

### Fixed

- Fixed mermaid diagrams rendering with black filled edge shapes and missing node/arrow styling: the webview CSP blocked the SVG's `<style>` elements and inline style attributes; `style-src` keeps the nonce while `style-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` allows inline style attributes, dynamically created `<style>` elements are stamped with the style nonce via a `document.createElement` patch, and mermaid's in-SVG `<style>` elements are re-created inside the diagram container with the real nonce (serialization hides nonce values, so the originals arrive blocked).
- Fixed mermaid `<style>` elements accumulating in `document.head` on every re-render or message removal; re-created styles now live inside the diagram container and are removed with it.
- Fixed code blocks rendering blank for unsupported languages (e.g. mermaid); the DOM source is hidden only when the canvas draw succeeds.
- Fixed user messages showing raw `<file>` blocks of expanded `@file` mentions.
- Fixed code blocks flickering while streaming.
- Fixed the chat view jumping to the bottom while scrolling up.
- Fixed failed assistant turns rendering as an empty message with no visible error; the chat now shows the provider error text in place of the reply.
- Fixed `@scope/name` tokens with a file extension (e.g. `@pro-uni/package.json`) rendering as yellow package names instead of clickable file links.
- Fixed `@` mention edge cases: paths really starting with `@` (e.g. a top-level `@scope` folder) round-trip as `@@path` and open correctly, completion matches files by any path segment instead of just the filename, and caret movement no longer leaves the completion menu anchored to a stale position.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Replaced the in-webview chat history panel with a native QuickPick for switching sessions.
- Improved webview rendering with batched streaming updates, collapsible long code blocks, and truncated tool output previews with a "Show full output" toggle.
- Added support for sending steer and follow-up messages while Pi is running: `Cmd+Enter` sends a steer, `Alt+Enter` queues a follow-up, with a pending queue display and restore-to-input action.

### Changed

- Shortened the model status label in the chat composer to show the model name only; the full provider/model path remains available on hover.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Added chat input history navigation with the up and down arrow keys.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Fixed packaged VSIX changelogs to omit development-only Unreleased sections.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Fixed packaged VSIX artifacts to exclude generated declaration files and source maps.
